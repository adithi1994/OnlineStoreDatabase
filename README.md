Task: Database for an Online Store 

 

Description: Create and manipulate tables for an e-commerce store with products, customers, and orders. 

 

Task 1: Write SQL queries to: 

Create three tables: Products, Customers, and Orders. 

Insert sample data for at least 10 products, 5 customers, and 10 orders. 

 

Task 2: Use ALTER to add new columns like discount in the              Products table, and then UPDATE to modify some data. 

 

Task 3: Write a query that selects all orders with a total value above $100 and sorts them by the order date in descending order. 

 

Task 4: Use GROUP BY to group orders by customer and calculate the total amount spent by each customer. 

 

Task 5: Add a HAVING clause to filter out customers who spent less than $500. 

Task 6: Write queries that calculate the average price of products, the maximum order value, and the total number of products in the store using AVG(), MAX(), SUM(), and COUNT(). 

 

Task 7: Use comparison and logical operators (e.g., BETWEEN, LIKE, AND, OR) to find all products with prices between $20 and $50 or those that contain the keyword "Laptop" in their names. 

 

Task 8: Write an INNER JOIN query to retrieve a list of all customer names along with their order details. 

 

Task 9: Use LEFT JOIN to retrieve all products and their corresponding orders, ensuring that products with no orders are still shown. 

 

Task 10: Use RIGHT JOIN to get all customers and their orders, including customers who havenâ€™t placed any orders.
